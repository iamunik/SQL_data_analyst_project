# SQL Data Analysis Project: Sales Performance and Customer Insights

## Introduction

This comprehensive data analysis project focuses on extracting actionable insights from a retail business's sales and customer subscription data using SQL. The analysis spans two major domains: sales performance metrics and customer behavior patterns, providing a holistic view of the business's operational effectiveness and customer engagement.

## Project Overview

The analysis is structured into two main components:

1. **Sales Performance Analysis:**
   This segment delves into the granular aspects of product performance, regional distribution, and revenue patterns. The analysis includes tracking product category sales, identifying regional transaction patterns, and monitoring monthly revenue trends. This provides valuable insights into product performance and helps identify areas for potential growth and optimization.

2. **Customer Subscription Analysis:**
   The second component focuses on understanding customer behavior through subscription patterns, regional distribution, and retention metrics. This analysis helps identify customer preferences, retention challenges, and opportunities for improving customer lifetime value.

## Business Objectives

- Identify top-performing products and regions to optimize inventory and marketing strategies
- Understand customer subscription patterns to improve retention rates
- Analyze regional performance to guide expansion decisions
- Track revenue patterns to support financial planning and forecasting
- Monitor customer churn patterns to develop targeted retention strategies
